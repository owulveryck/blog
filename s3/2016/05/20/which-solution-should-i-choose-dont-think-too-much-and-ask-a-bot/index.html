<h1 id="let-me-tell-you-a-story-the-why">Let me tell you a story: the why!</h1>

<p>A year ago, one of those Sunday morning where spring starts to warm up the souls, I went, as usual to my favorite bakery.
The family tradition is to come back with a bunch of &ldquo;Pains au Chocolat&rdquo; (which, are, you can trust me, simply excellent).</p>

<ul>
<li><em>hello sir, I&rsquo;d like 4 of your excellent &ldquo;pains au chocolat&rdquo; please</em></li>
<li><em>I&rsquo;m sorry, I don&rsquo;t have any &ldquo;pains au chocolat&rdquo; nor any &ldquo;croissant&rdquo; anymore</em></li>
<li><em>what? How is it possible ?</em></li>
<li><em>everything has been sold.</em></li>
<li><em>too bad&hellip;</em></li>
</ul>

<p>I think to myself: <em>why didn&rsquo;t you made more?</em>. He may have read my thought and told me</p>

<ul>
<li><em>I wish I could have foreseen</em></li>
</ul>

<p>When I left his shop, his words were echoing&hellip; I wish I could have foreseen&hellip; We have self-driving cars, we have the Internet,
we are a civilization that is technology advanced.
Facebook recognize your face among billions as soon as you post a photo&hellip; It must be possible to foresee&hellip;</p>

<p>This is how I started to gain interest in machine learning</p>

<p>At first I started to read some papers, then I learn (a very little bit) about graph theory, Bayesian networks, Markov chains.
But I was not accurate and I felt I was missing some basic theory.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the main reason why, 8 weeks ago, I signed in a course about <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning">&ldquo;Machine learning&rdquo; on Coursera</a>.
This course is given by <a href="http://www.andrewng.org/">Andrew Ng</a> from <a href="https://www.stanford.edu/">Stanford University</a>.</p>

<p>It is an excellent introduction that gives me all the tools I need to go deeper in this science. The course is based on real examples
and uses powerful mathematics without going too deeply in the proofs.</p>

<h1 id="so-what">So what?</h1>

<p>The course is not finished yet, but after about 8 weeks, I&rsquo;ve learned a lot about what we call &ldquo;machine learning&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The main idea of the machine learning is:</p>

<ul>
<li>to feed some code with a bunch of data (who said big data was useless)</li>
<li>to code or encode some mathematical formulas that could represent the data</li>
<li>to implement any algorithm that optimize the formulas by minimizing the error made by the machine on the evolving data sets.</li>
</ul>

<p>To make it simple: machine learning is feeding a &ldquo;robot&rdquo; with data and teach him how to analyse the errors so it can make decisions on its own.</p>

<p>Scary isn&rsquo;t it? But so exciting&hellip; As usual I won&rsquo;t go into ethical debate on this blog, and I will stick to science and on the benefit
of the science.</p>

<p>But indeed, always remind Fran√ßois Rabelais:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Science sans conscience n&rsquo;est que ruine de l&rsquo;&acirc;me (<em>Science without conscience is but the ruin of the soul</em>)</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="a-use-case">A use case</h2>

<h3 id="defining-the-problem">Defining the problem</h3>

<p>I have 4 technical solutions providing a similar goal: deliver cloud services.
Actually, none of them is fulfilling all the requirements of my business.
As usual, one is good in a certain area, while another one is weak, etc.</p>

<p>A team of people has evaluated more than 100 criteria, and gave two quotations per criteria and per product:</p>

<ul>
<li>the first quotation is in the range 0/3 and indicated whether the product is fulfilling the current feature</li>
<li>the second quotation may be {0,1,3,9} and points the effort needed to reach a 3 for the feature</li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore, for each solution, I have a table looking like this :</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>feature  name</th>
<th>feature evaluation</th>
<th>effort</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>feature 1</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>9</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>feature 2</td>
<td>3</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>feature 3</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>feature 4</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>&hellip;&hellip;.</td>
<td>&hellip;</td>
<td>&hellip;</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>feature 100</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been asked to evaluate the product and to produce a comparison.</p>

<p>To do an analytic, I must look for an element of comparison. So I&rsquo;ve turned the problem into this :</p>

<p><strong>I would like to know which product is the cheapest to fulfill my requirement.</strong></p>

<p>(I&rsquo;ve uploaded my samples here):</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/assets/ml/solution1.csv">solution 1</a></li>
<li><a href="/assets/ml/solution2.csv">solution 2</a></li>
<li><a href="/assets/ml/solution3.csv">solution 3</a></li>
<li><a href="/assets/ml/solution4.csv">solution 4</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="finding-a-solution">Finding a solution</h3>

<p>In the machine learning, we notice two different fields of application:</p>

<ul>
<li>regression</li>
<li>classification</li>
</ul>

<p>The classification mechanism would be used to answer a yes/no question; for example: <em>should I keep solution 1</em> ?
The regression mechanism helps us for &ldquo;predicting&rdquo;. Actually, the goal is to <em>automatically</em> find a mathematical formulae that turns
a set of feature into a result.</p>

<p>what is a feature, and what&rsquo;s the result?
Let&rsquo;s go back to my <em>petits pains</em> example.</p>

<p>Consider that the baker has made statistics on its production for sunday, and it has taken some events into consideration:</p>

<ul>
<li>sunday the 1st: it was raining, I sold only 100 petits Pains</li>
<li>sunday the 8th: it was sunny, I sold 250 petits Pains</li>
<li>sunday the 16th: it was sunny, and it was a special day (eg: mother&rsquo;s day): 300 petits Pains</li>
<li>sunday the 24th: it was cloudy: 150 petits Pains</li>
</ul>

<p>Here, the baker thinks that its production must be a function of the weather and the calendar; therefore those are the two features.
What ML propose is to tell the baker how many &ldquo;petits pains&rdquo; he should make <strong>knowing</strong> that it is a special day (father&rsquo;s day) and that it
is partially sunny&hellip;</p>

<p>Back in the context of this post, the goal of the regression would be to find a mathematical function that will tell me the effort needed
for any value, and doing this on the simple basis of the training set I have.</p>

<h4 id="the-actual-score-of-all-the-solutions">The actual score of all the solutions</h4>

<p>The first thing to find it the total score of all the 4 solutions.
If I consider $m$ features, the total score of the solution is defined by:</p>

<p>$ score = \frac{1}{m} . \sum_{k=1}^{m} feature_k $</p>

<p>What I need now, is to evaluate the effort needed to reach a score of 3 for each solution.
Let&rsquo;s do that.</p>

<h4 id="representing-the-training-set">Representing the training set</h4>

<p>First, let&rsquo;s plot the training set.
<center>
<img class="img-responsive" src="/assets/images/ml/trainingset.jpg" alt="Training set"/>
</center></p>

<p><strong>note</strong> the representation is not accurate because there may be several bunk points</p>

<p>I will use in this post what&rsquo;s called &ldquo;supervised learning&rdquo;. That means that I will express a skeleton of function and let the machine
adjust it. (actually this is a very basic and week implementation; a lot more complex examples may be implemented but that&rsquo;s not the purpose of this post)</p>

<p>When I look at the training set representation, I can imagine a line passing by the middle of the plots.
This line may look like this:</p>

<p><center>
<img class="img-responsive" src="/assets/images/ml/x-1_5.jpg" alt="x^(-1/5)"/>
</center></p>

<p>This is actually a representation of the function $ x^{\frac{1}{5}} $</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s assume that this function may basically fit my example, my goal will be to adapt the function.
assume this equation with two parameters $\theta_0$ and $\theta_1$ that will influence the curve:</p>

<p>$ f(x) = \theta_0 + \theta_1 . x^{\frac{1}{5}} $</p>

<p>Therefore, my goal will be to code something so that the machine will figure out what $\theta_0$ and $\theta_1$  are.</p>

<p>I will use an implementation of an algorithm called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent">gradient descent</a> for linear regression.
I won&rsquo;t go into the details of this algorithm, as it takes a complete course to be explained.</p>

<p>The implementation is made with <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/">GNU octave</a> and the code is available on my <a href="https://github.com/owulveryck/linear-regression-example">github</a></p>

<h2 id="the-computation-and-the-result">The computation and the result</h2>

<p>Here is a figure representing the function for one particular solution:
<center>
<img class="img-responsive" src="/assets/images/ml/trainingset_plot.jpg" alt="Training set with the function"/>
</center></p>

<p>We can see that the curve is &ldquo;under fitting&rdquo; the data.
Anyway, let&rsquo;s continue and get the result I want (I will explain later how to perform better):</p>

<p>Here are the computational results:
<pre>
octave:10&gt; compute
Analysing solution1.csv:0.<sup>67</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>
Running gradient descent&hellip;
Theta found by gradient descent: 5.397050 -4.315835

Effort (scaled to 10): 1.957075</p>

<p>Analysing solution3.csv:0.<sup>67</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>

<p>Analysing solution4.csv:0.<sup>86</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>

Prediction for x=0.858268 ; 0.755175
Prediction for x=3 ; 0.086926
Effort (scaled to 10): 2.152261
</pre></p>

<p>For each solution, I have:</p>

<ul>
<li>the score (the first line /3)</li>
<li>the parameters $\theta$</li>
<li>a prediction for the actual score, and for a score of 3</li>
<li>the effort (scale on 10) needed to pass from the actual score to 3</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="final-result">Final result</h4>

<p>Here is the final classification of my four solutions:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Solution</th>
<th>score</th>
<th>effort</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Solution 2</td>
<td>0.96</td>
<td>1.95</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Solution 4</td>
<td>0.86</td>
<td>2.15</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Solution 3</td>
<td>0.67</td>
<td>2.54</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Solution 1</td>
<td>0.67</td>
<td>2.58</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Solution 2 is the cheapest. It&rsquo;s possible to go into further analysis to determine why it&rsquo;s the cheapest, and how the other ones
may catch up and go back in the race, but again, that is not the purpose of my post.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>This is a simple approach.
Some axis of optimization could be to use a more complex polynomial (eg: $\theta_0+\theta_1.x^\frac{1}{3}+\theta_2.x^\frac{1}{5}$)
or to use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine">support vector machine</a> with a gaussian kernel for example.</p>

<p>One other optimization would be to add some more features, such as, for example, a score on the importance of a feature (a functional feature).</p>

<p>Machine learning is a wide mathematical and IT area. It is now in everyone&rsquo;s life.
Nowadays we are talking about plateform fully automated, self-healing applications, smart deployements, smart monitoring.
There are already some good implementations of algorithms on the market, but there is a huge place for integration of those tools into
the life of the IT specialist.</p>

<p>Automation has already helped and took the boring job of the IT specialist. Smart automation will go a step further.</p>
