      <description>Introduction I usually don&amp;rsquo;t like slidewares.
Actually as IT engineer working, by now, exclusively in France, I&amp;rsquo;m facing the PowerPoint problem:
 Too many boring slides, too much information per slide, a presenter dedicated to read their content.  Therefore, the audience is watching its watch while waiting for a coffee break.
I won&amp;rsquo;t redo the introduction I already did in a previous post but indeed slides can, from time to time, be a value-add to a presentation.</description>

      <description>the goal As all my peers, I have the opportunity to talk about different technological aspects. As all my peers, I&amp;rsquo;m asked to present a bunch of slides (powerpoint or keynote, or whatever).
In this post I won&amp;rsquo;t dig into what&amp;rsquo;s good or not to put in a presentation, and if that&amp;rsquo;s what interest you, I recommend you to take a look at Garr Reynold&amp;rsquo;s tips and tricks.
