      <description>In the cloud computing, alongside of the hosting monsters such as amazon or google, there is the Openstack Platform.
Openstack is not a single software, it is more a galaxy of components aim to control the infrastructure, such as hardware pools, storage, network. The management can then be done via a Web based interface or via a bunch of RESTful API.
I would like to evaluate its identity service named keystone and use it as a AuthN and AuthZ backend for my simple_iaas example.</description>
