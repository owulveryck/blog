      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I last posted something. I will fill the gap with a quick post about rekognition.
rekognition is a service from AWS that is described as:
 Deep learning-based image recognition
Search, verify, and organize millions of images
 In this light post, I will present a simple method to grab a picture from my webcam, send it to rekognition and display the result.
The part of the result I will focus on is the emotion.</description>

      <description>Introduction System engineers are used to CSV files. They may be considered as a good bridge between Excel and the CLI. They are also a common way to format the output of a script so data can be exploited easily from command lines tools such as sort , awk,uniq, grep, and so on.
The point is that when there is a significant amount of data, parsing it with shell may be painful and extremely slow.</description>

      <description>Introduction I usually don&amp;rsquo;t like slidewares.
Actually as IT engineer working, by now, exclusively in France, I&amp;rsquo;m facing the PowerPoint problem:
 Too many boring slides, too much information per slide, a presenter dedicated to read their content.  Therefore, the audience is watching its watch while waiting for a coffee break.
I won&amp;rsquo;t redo the introduction I already did in a previous post but indeed slides can, from time to time, be a value-add to a presentation.</description>

      <description>Introduction A bunch of friends/colleagues offered me a raspberry pi 3. It may become my VPN gateway, or my firewall, or the brain of my CCTV, or maybe the center of an alarm&amp;hellip;. Maybe a spotify player&amp;hellip;
Anyway, I have installed raspbian and I&amp;rsquo;m now playing with it.
Yesterday evening, as I was about to go to bed, I&amp;rsquo;ve had a very bad idea&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;ve linked together my rpi and my Oregon Weather Station.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been about a year that I started to read the tutorial on Hidden Markov Models and selected applications in speech recognition from Lawrence R. Rabiner.
This paper is a reference in term of HMM application. The problem was that even with a lot of effort and concentration, I was lacking a bunch of skills to fully understand it. As I&amp;rsquo;ve now studied a bit, with the support of Coursera and the lectures of Andrew Ng, I will try to dig into it again.</description>

      <description>the goal As all my peers, I have the opportunity to talk about different technological aspects. As all my peers, I&amp;rsquo;m asked to present a bunch of slides (powerpoint or keynote, or whatever).
In this post I won&amp;rsquo;t dig into what&amp;rsquo;s good or not to put in a presentation, and if that&amp;rsquo;s what interest you, I recommend you to take a look at Garr Reynold&amp;rsquo;s tips and tricks.

      <description>Let me tell you a story: the why! A year ago, one of those Sunday morning where spring starts to warm up the souls, I went, as usual to my favorite bakery. The family tradition is to come back with a bunch of &amp;ldquo;Pains au Chocolat&amp;rdquo; (which, are, you can trust me, simply excellent).
 hello sir, I&amp;rsquo;d like 4 of your excellent &amp;ldquo;pains au chocolat&amp;rdquo; please I&amp;rsquo;m sorry, I don&amp;rsquo;t have any &amp;ldquo;pains au chocolat&amp;rdquo; nor any &amp;ldquo;croissant&amp;rdquo; anymore what?</description>

      <description>Introduction Opening remarks I&amp;rsquo;m not a Ruby developer, and I&amp;rsquo;m heavily discovering the ecosystem by now. This are my notes, and if anything seems wrong to you, do not hesitate to send me remarks.
The scenario For testing purpose, I wanted to play with vagrant-aws and more generally with ruby on my Chromebook.
Vagrant does not support rubygems as installation method anymore (see Mitchell Hashimoto&amp;rsquo;s post) and of course, there is no binary distribution available for the Chromebook.</description>

      <description>What we do here is online learning because it is not possible to provide a set of data. Actually, if the expectation is part of predetermined vector of states (${start, stop, confgure,&amp;hellip;}) for any topology, the way to achieve the goal and reach the state is different for every topology (the deployement plan is different).
the definition of the universe We have to define the universe in which our machine evolve in order to bound the events that may interact with it.</description>

      <description>Introduction In my last post I introduced the notion of choreography as a way to deploy an manage application. It could be possible to implement self-healing, elasticity and in a certain extent self awareness.
To do so, we must not rely on the certainty and the determinism of the automated tasks. Mark Burgess explains in his book in search of certainty that none should consider the command and control anymore.</description>

      <description>About the server I have subscribed for a now dedicated BSD box. The provider is OVH, and this box is hosted in Canada.
It&amp;rsquo;s been a few years since I first subscribed a box a OVH, and I really enjoy their service.
The main usage for this box is a geek box. I use it to exeperiment some stuffs, I cannot experiment into my home PC. Therefore I usually create a bunch of jails, and each jail is dedicated to a task</description>

      <description>In the cloud computing, alongside of the hosting monsters such as amazon or google, there is the Openstack Platform.
Openstack is not a single software, it is more a galaxy of components aim to control the infrastructure, such as hardware pools, storage, network. The management can then be done via a Web based interface or via a bunch of RESTful API.
I would like to evaluate its identity service named keystone and use it as a AuthN and AuthZ backend for my simple_iaas example.</description>
