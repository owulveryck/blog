I've had the oportunity to attend the configuration management camp in Gent (be) for its 2016 edition.

I really enjoyed those two days of talks, exposing different principles of what could be the future of the infrastructure engineer.
Beyond the technical demonstrations and the experience sharing, I did spot a bunch of principles.

Among them, thoses that actually comes to me are:

> You don't need configuration management, what you need is a description of the topology of your application (Mark Shuttleworth in its talk _The magic of modeling_)

> You don't need orchestration, what you need is choreography (julian dunn)

> What we need is a new way to do configuration management (james)

Here is what I may tell you about thoses poins:

# You don't need configuration management...

## What we need is a description of the application

Mark Shuttleworth did a very cool introduction keynote.
Its purpose was to introduce `juju`; but the fact is that juju is an answer to modern needs.

## And an orchestrator to materialize the model

# Actually, what we need is choreography
