I've had the oportunity to attend the configuration management camp in Gent (be) for its 2016 edition.

I really enjoyed those two days of talks, watching the folks to expose different ideas of what could be the future
of the infrastructure and deployment engineering. 
Beyond the technical demonstrations and the experience sharing, I've spotted a bunch of ideas

Among them, those that comes to me spontaneously are:

> You don't need configuration management, what you need is a description of the topology of your application - *Mark Shuttleworth* in its keynote _The magic of modeling_

> You don't need orchestration, what you need is choreography - Exposed by _Julian Dunn_ (you can find a retranscription [here on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfF9IATUask))

> What we need is a new way to do configuration management - _James Shubin_, see [his blog post](https://ttboj.wordpress.com/2016/01/18/next-generation-configuration-mgmt/) which ispired me

Here is what I may tell you about thoses poins:

# You don't need configuration management...

## What we need is a description of the application

Mark Shuttleworth did a very cool introduction keynote.
Its purpose was to introduce `juju`; but the fact is that juju is an answer to modern needs.

## And an orchestrator to materialize the model

# Actually, what we need is choreography
