title: When I apply a 350€ update on the iPhone
---

I am an apple client for years now. I was very pleased with the apple customer care until the day I really needed something from them.

This post is the "why". But as you are on a technical blog the idea behind this post is:

* to explain the reason of wrath that made me dig into the deep understanding of my phone and
* to give technical facts and hints to any geek that would like to investigate an iPhone issue based on what I learned (this is, according to me, the most interesting part)

# Part I:  The facts

I have add an iPhones, iPads and MacBook. I made this choice for different reasons amongst:

* the quality of the products
* the very user friendly interface
* the security of the phone
* the implicit contract that apple provides: "nevemind, apple will take care"

Of course, those reasons are personals and can be argued (and subject to _troll_), but this is not the point of this article.
