# Introduction

Single page application (SPA) are a standard when dealing with mobile apps.
Unfortunatly, by now, javascript is the only programming language supported by a browser.

Therefore, to code web UI it remains a must.

## Life of an ex sysadmin who wants to code a web app

To make the development easier, your friend, who is "web developper" will recommand you to use a marvelous framework.
Depending on the orientation of the wind, the moon or its reading, he will encourage you to use `reactjs`, `angular`, `ember` or whatever exotic
tool.

With some recommandation from my real friends and from google, I've started an app based on [ionic](http://ionicframework.com/) which is based on [angular](https://angularjs.org/).
As I did not know anything about angular, I've watched a (very good) [introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9MHigUZKEM) and followed the ionic tututorial.

So far so good...
