# the goal
As all my peers, I have the opportunity to talk about different technological aspects.
As all my peers, I'm asked to present a bunch of slides (powerpoint or keynote, or whatever).

In this post I won't dig into what's good or not to put in a presentation, and if that's what interest you, I 
recommend you to take a look at [Garr Reynold's tips and tricks](http://reference).

(actually it has been reported in its book) (TODO: references)

As an attendee I tend to agree; usually PowerPoints are boring and they hardly give any interest besides for the writer to say "hey look, I've worked for this presentation".

Indeed, they are a must. So for my next presentation I thought: 

wouldn't it be nice to use this wide display area to make the presentation more interactive.
One of the key point in communication is to federate people. So what if people could get represented for real in the presentation.

## how to dothat
