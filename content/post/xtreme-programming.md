# Part I: Agility

## 2003

I have discovered the notion of extreme programming more than 15 years ago. My job was integrate *and* to develop pieces of code in Java for the IBM Websphere Business Integration server.
We were a small team with light programming skills part of our job was to operate the software, the other part was to develop. It was in 2003.

We were trying hard to stick to the framework we developed specially. 

Of course, in 2003, no French company I have been working for was talking about agility, The minimum viable product was not an option. The client wanted the full viable product delivered on time.

One of those morning where we were trying to find the motivation to do another step in the unknown, a colleague told us about a "new concept" he read about: Extreme Programming.

He explained that we should work in pairs. He told us that we should test every single feature even before actually implementing it, and so many other things... The ideas were good, but the milestones of the project were short. Obviously we were _too busy to innovate_ .

(By the time, as I grew up, I learned that _Good ideas don't always win!)_

At the end of the project, when the [Deming wheel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDCA) turned, I noticed that we were missing of agility.

## 2017

It is now 2017. Every IT crew thinks that agility is the way to work. 
Some of them have enough support from their management to actually implement an agile method.
Others may not be mature enough, but are pushed by the never-ending decrease of the time to market to try new methods of work and delivery.

But when it comes to agility, people nowadays refer to [scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)) or sometimes [kanan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development)).

Extreme Programming remains rare. See for example this Google trend chart about agility in IT:

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://ssl.gstatic.com/trends_nrtr/981_RC01/embed_loader.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript"> trends.embed.renderExploreWidget("TIMESERIES", {"comparisonItem":[{"keyword":"/m/02t2n","geo":"","time":"2012-03-18 2017-03-18"},{"keyword":"/m/02zhbn","geo":"","time":"2012-03-18 2017-03-18"},{"keyword":"/m/0ck_p8","geo":"","time":"2012-03-18 2017-03-18"},{"keyword":"/m/01mwhw","geo":"","time":"2012-03-18 2017-03-18"}],"category":0,"property":""}, {"exploreQuery":"date=2012-03-18%202017-03-18&q=%2Fm%2F02t2n,%2Fm%2F02zhbn,%2Fm%2F0ck_p8,%2Fm%2F01mwhw","guestPath":"https://trends.google.com:443/trends/embed/"}); </script> 

On the other hand, people do not oppose agility and [lean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_software_development) anymore.

But still, IT crew usually refer to those concepts as _Tools for the devs_. But Ops should not be opposed to Devs in the strict sense. Actually **Ops are also developing their business**.
In the era of "services everywhere" (_XaaS_), pure Ops teams must define contracts of services. Therefore they must develop the services to fulfill the contracts. 

More and more Ops will need development skills, but they even will more need methods. Scrum is a good way to start. 


# Part II: Using extreme programming in an "Ops" team

## Context

"Ops" team developing a service. Dev and ops together that work better in pair

## Sprinting
_Lean on me_


## Pair programming

## TDD



with my colleague [Alexandre](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandre-hisette-aa1076a/) from Techsys

# Conclusion

I the sprint review meeting, of course my own goals were not reached. I have passed too many times to work with my colleague to make my complete my own tasks.

My "product" was enhanced of 2% instead of 5%, but the other product, the one developed in pair, increased by 10%. On the average, the quality of the whole service provided by the team made a grater gap.
Moreover we were both proud of what we accomplished. The code was clean, documented and tested.

* Learing was amplified
* team was empowered
* the service was more consistent as a whole (two heads are better than one)
