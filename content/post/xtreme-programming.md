# Part I: Agility

## 2003

I have discovered the notion of extreme programming more than 15 years ago. My job was integrate *and* to develop pieces of code in Java for the IBM Websphere Business Integration server.
We were a small team with light programming skills part of our job was to operate the software, the other part was to develop. It was in 2003.

We were trying hard to stick to the framework we developped specially. 

Of course, in 2003, no french company I was working for was talking about agility, The minimum viable product was not an option. The client wanted the full viable product delivered on time.

One of those morning where we were trying to find the motivation to do another step in the unknown, a colleague told us about a "new concept" he read about: Extreme Programming.

He explained that we should work in pairs. He told us that we should test every single feature even before actually implementing it, and so many other things... The ideas were good, but the milestones of the project were short. Obviously we were _too busy to innovate_ .

(By the time, as I grew up, I learned that _Good ideas don't always win!)_

At the end of the project, when moved the [deming wheel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDCA) I noticed that we were missing of agility.

## 2017

It is now 2017. Every IT crew thinks that agility is the way to work. 
Some of them have enough support from their management to actually implement an agile method.
Others may not be mature enough, but are pushed by the neverending decrease of the time to market to try new method of work and delivery.

But when it comes to agility, people nowadays refer to [scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)) or sometimes [kanan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development)).

But when people refers to agile methods, they usually forget one of the goal which is [lean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_software_development).

# Part II: Implementation

## Context

"Ops" team developing a service. Dev and ops together that work better in pair

## Sprinting


## Pair programming

## TDD
