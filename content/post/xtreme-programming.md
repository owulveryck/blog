# Part I: Agility

## 2003

I have discovered the notion of extreme programming more than 15 years ago. My job integrate *and* to develop pieces of code in Java for the IBM Websphere Business Integration server.
We were a small team with light programming skills part of our job was to operate the software, the other part was to develop. It was in 2003.

We were trying hard to stick to the framework we developped specially. 

Of course, in 2003, no french company I was working for was talking about agility, The minimum viable product was not an option. The client wanted the full viable product delivered on time.

One of those morning where we were trying to find the motivation to do another step in the unknown, a colleague told us about a "new concept" he read about: Extreme Programming.

## 2017


When it comes to agility, people nowadays refer to "scrum" or sometimes "kanban".
