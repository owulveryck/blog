title: Configuration management is a solved problem!
---

This year, I have attended to the configuration management camp in gent thanks to [Techsys](http://www.techsys.fr).
It is the second year I attend to those conferences.
Last year, as I mentionned in [my review](/2016/02/10/configuration-management-choreography-and-self-aware-applications/index.html) the main topic was about orchestration and choreography.

This year's edition was more about the maturity of the configuration management.

# The maturity of the tools

# The economy around the tools

# Containers...

## Operating systems are assholes

# Conclusion
